# Kotaku UK RSS (for fun)

So [Kotaku UK](http://www.kotaku.co.uk) does not have an RSS feed right
now. And as I'm still teaching myself [Go](http://golang.org/), I figured it
would be a fun small project to build a scraper that serves up an RSS feed for
my personal use.

## Building/Running

```
go get github.com/kr/godep
godep go build
PORT=5000 ./kotaku-uk-rss
```

## Deploying to Heroku

```
git clone git@github.com:jimeh/kotaku-uk-rss.git
cd kotaku-uk-rss
heroku create -b https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go.git
git push heroku master
```

## Technical

When launched, the process does two things:

1. Starts a goroutine that will fetch a list of articles from the first 3
   pages of kotaku.co.uk, and building and caching a RSS XML string from those
   articles. This is repeated every 60 seconds.
2. Starts a web-server on `PORT` number serving up cached RSS feed on `/rss`.
